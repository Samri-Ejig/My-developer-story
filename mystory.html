        <h1>My developer story
        </h1>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>My name is Samrawit Debebe, i prefere to be called "Samri". I have been working as a piblic health professional
            for different organizations and currently i am adding web development skill to my career.
        I was first introduced to computers at school when I was an elementary student. 
                I start by creating folders, saving , renaming and also painting. 
                But, I never had a chance to explore more until I became a university student.
            <br>
        </br>
        After graduating from university, I saved some money to buy my personal computer from my first job. 
                I remember, it was Toshiba, big screen and heavy to travel with. 
                It was the first big thing I bought for myself without any parent support and the excitement was huge. 
            
            <br>
        </br>
            However, I started to depend on computers and explore more when I joined international NGOs
                 and using Project management softwares, data analytics tools and report writing became a must
                  to acquire skills.
                  <br>
        </br>
            I became more interested in data analytic and visualization tools which led me to take online training on  sql, 
                Tableau, Python and PowerBI from Coursera, Udemy and other YouTube Videos. 
            
            <br>
        </br>
            In addition to my interest and the demand from my work environment , I began 
                to see the world is depending on computers / AI for problem solving and I started to explore more. </li>
                <br>
            </br>
            When I got a chance to join refcode, I got excited because I 
                believed this would  be the beginning for my programming career.
