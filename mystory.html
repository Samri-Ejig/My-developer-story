        <h3>My developer story</h3>
        <p>My name is Samrawit Debebe, i prefere to be called "Samri". 
            <br>
        </br>
        I am a public health professional with 12 years of experience in Mentoring, program coordination, 
        grant and partnership management, 
        Data use, and advocacy for policy change in areas of HIV/AIDS, SRH/FP, quality assurance, immunization, surveillance, and Outbreak Responses. 
        She has strong interpersonal communication, team building, and analytical skill. 
            <br>
        </br>
        After graduating from university, I saved some money to buy my personal computer from my first job. 
                I remember, it was Toshiba, big screen and heavy to travel with. 
                It was the first big thing I bought for myself without any parent support and the excitement was huge. 
            
            <br>
        </br>
            However, I started to depend on computers and explore more when I joined international NGOs
                 and using Project management softwares, data analytics tools and report writing became a must
                  to acquire skills.
                  <br>
        </br>
            I became more interested in data analytic and visualization tools which led me to take online training on  sql, 
                Tableau, Python and PowerBI from Coursera, Udemy and other YouTube Videos. 
            
            <br>
        </br>
            In addition to my interest and the demand from my work environment , I began 
                to see the world is depending on computers / AI for problem solving and I started to explore more. </li>
                <br>
            </br>
            When I got a chance to join refcode, I got excited because I 
                believed this would  be the beginning for my programming career.
